problem:
When creating the object, it needs a card_back image, and should be created with card back image
you can only have 1 image sheet available to each object, 
gimp image fix:
    every image sheet would have card_back on it
better fix:
    need to create a func for objectAssets to return an image based on string, but find and load the correct sheet based on the image name
